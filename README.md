This repository contains code and files for an Insight Data Science Fellowship project.

The idea behind the project is to develop a mobile phone app that returns a Yelp page of a restaurant after the cell phone camera is used to photograph the restaurant shopfront.

The project implements a web-based prototype written in Flask and Python.

The maxvp directory contains the latest commit for the project. This includes Jupyter notebooks where the image processing algorithm was developed, and Flask files for creating the web app. The directory name maxvp stands for maximum value product. This name was used to distinguish it from 'mvp', which stands for minimum value product and was the stage of the project presented to the group at the end of week 2 of the fellowship.

The other directories, static, tutorial, jqueryexample, and imgJquery were used while learning to write the Flask app.
